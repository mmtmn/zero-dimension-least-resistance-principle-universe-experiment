## multi dimensional view (inside view) (no gravity)


### more depth, less points (no gravity)

### less depth, more points (no gravity)

## observations of multi-dimensional.c
- more points = more spherical
- less points = more web like view


### control commands:
- awsd to move
- move mouse to rotate
- q goes down
- e goes up


### warning:
- reduce number of points or depth if the program hangs after executing it

DISCLAIMER: Adding gravity here didn't make sense to me, at the end I found a really cool theory I ended up coding!

DISCLAIMER: I ended creating a new repository for this theory, it was too interesting, needed more attention to be more accurate to the research paper and ended up becoming 500+ lines of C code!
